Challenge #1
found ng-app was written without the = sign. fixed

checked app.js for issues, found urlRouterProvider missing and added a .otherwise

fixed the way that the .states were written, ie, closing parens in wrong place instead of colon.

found ui-router... fixed it to say ui.router

checked prouctService and productsCtrl, found and fixed... prouctService not included in productsCtrl parameters
found missing closing curly bracket for .controller

found view-container behind nav sidebar... added left margin to pull the view over to the right.
